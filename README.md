# Tello Edu Drone Mock Server

This mock server facilitate rapid development with the Tello Edu drones using SDK 2.0.

## Control Command Server

The server is setup to listen on port 8889 for the commands found in the Tello SDK 2.0 and send the appropriate response.

## Tello State Server

Additionally, the server will stream simulated telemetry data on port 8890. The data structure matches the same string that the tello will output, but the values are randomly generated.
